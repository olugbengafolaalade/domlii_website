Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, Domlii, the Domlii entities, its agents, representatives, and service providers’ liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by law.<br><br>Vendor’s representations<br>Domlii shall neither be liable for actions or omissions of the Vendor nor you regarding the provision of the Goods and where Vendor Delivery applies to your order.
